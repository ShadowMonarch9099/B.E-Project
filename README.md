# B.E. Final Year Project: Multilingual Document Intelligence (RAG)

Final year B.E. project, Department of Artificial Intelligence & Data Science, MMCOE Pune (SPPU).

A citation-grounded Retrieval-Augmented Generation system for private English, Hindi and Marathi document collections (native PDFs, DOCX and scanned documents), with page-level citations and abstention when evidence is insufficient.

**Team:** Tanmay Gosavi, Kush Honkalse
**Guide:** Mr. Rishikesh C. Yeolekar

## Research questions

1. Which retrieval strategy (direct multilingual, translation-based, hybrid dense + BM25) gives the best quality and cost for each language and document type?
2. Does hybrid retrieval with cross-encoder reranking improve page-cited answer faithfulness?
3. Can evidence-sufficiency checks reduce unsupported answers without unacceptable latency?
4. How consistently does the system answer in the requested language?

## Planned stack

FastAPI, Next.js, PostgreSQL + pgvector (HNSW), multilingual-E5, BM25 (IndicNLP tokens + character n-grams), fine-tuned multilingual cross-encoder reranker, Tesseract OCR (hin, mar, eng), AI4Bharat IndicLID / IndicXlit / IndicTrans2, a small local 4-bit instruct LLM, and a multilingual NLI verifier. See `docs/Review2_Plan.md` for details.
